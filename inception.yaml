          Hello everyone welcome to my YouTube channel, today we are going to cover
          about face recognition using inception v3 model on celebrity dataset containing
          105 images which are collected from Pinterest.

    - name: Dataset Formatting
    - short_desc: |
          a. Firstly we import the required libraries like tensorflow,numpy,os
          b. then we go to image directory and see the name of people who are in
              dataset.
          c. we then assign numberical value to various people present in the dataset
          d. we create a mapping of names and numerical value and a reverse mapping for
              resolving this will be used later to map predicted value to name of person
              of the dataset.
          e. Now we will create a dataset and a testset
          f. Firstly I will load the image from the path then convert the image into
              array and then normalize the image by dividing the image array with 255.0
              and then if the limit is less than 100 we will add the image to dataset
              else add it to testset
          g. Now we store the image array and its label in data and labels0 for dataset and
              test and tlabels0 for testset simultaneously.
          h. then we convert the label to categorical label and image array to numpy array
              and then the same thing to label variable.
          i. then we do the same thing to testset image array and label array.
          j. then we split the dataset into train and test split with sklearn function.
          k. then we see the shape of the variables we just made.
          l. we then use datagen functon of tensorflow it will be used  used to expand
              the training dataset in order to improve the performance and ability of the
              model to generalize.

    - name: Model Making / Customizing
    - short_desc: |
          a. Firstly, we get the number of classes presend in the dataset which is 105 in this case.
          b. Now, we add the inception model to the base_model with input shape of our image which is (120,120,3) which are height width and 3 for rgb.
          c. Then, we train all layers of inception except the last 2 layers.
          d. Now we make our final model by adding inception model on top followed bt global average pooling followed by last layer which is dense layer which has activation
              function softmax.
          e. Without output neuron being of no of classes.
          f. Now we compile the model with loss function being catgorical crossentropy with adam optimizer
          g. We compile see the summary of the model
          h. How we fit the data on the model and train with batches of size 32  for 30 epochs.
          i. Now we can see that the model accuracy is low being only 21 % you all can fine tune it.

    - name: Prediction
    - short_desc: |
          a. We load a image of bill gates from dataset.
          b. Now, we convert image into array for mapping which i load you all about in the start of this tutorial reverse mapping.
          c. Now, we sent the image to the model and prediction is mapped with reverse_mapping function adn we get the prediction that this is a
              picture of bill gates.
